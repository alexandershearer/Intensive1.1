The reason I believe this app is neccesary is because there is no app that really encourages artist collaboration while also being a great app for people to explore
art just for satisfaction and enjoyment. Being an artist myself I always struggle with pushing my ideas over the top or even having a really good platform where
I feel users can effectively find the content they desire. This app should give artists a place to post primarily. This should first start by letting the users make post
and anyone can view them once they are on the home page. The next step would be to sort all of those posts into their own categories depending on what the author 
puts in the style of art for the post.
